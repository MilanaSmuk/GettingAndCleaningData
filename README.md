# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

## Johns Hopkins University via Coursera.org
 
This repository contains the project assingment for Getting and Cleaning Data Course by Johns Hopkins University via Coursera.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The data represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Main task of this project is to make one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following 5 steps:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


This repository contains the following files:

1. run_analysis.R, the R script that was used to create the data set as a goal of this project
2. tidy_data.txt, which contains the result of R script, the tidy data set.
3. CodeBook.md, the code book whith description the data, variables and transformations used to make tidy data set.
4. README.md, this file which provides an overview of project.
